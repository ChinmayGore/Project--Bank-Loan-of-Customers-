Project: Loan Default Analysis | AI Variant Internship
During my internship at AI Variant, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting data analytics project focused on predicting loan defaulters. The goal was to analyze a bank dataset, identify key patterns, and develop insights that could help in assessing credit risk. This project allowed me to apply various data analysis and visualization techniques using Excel, Power BI, MySQL, and Tableau while also strengthening my ability to interpret financial data.

Approach & Tools Used
To begin, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Excel and MySQL. This step was crucial in handling missing values, detecting outliers, and ensuring data consistency for accurate analysis. MySQL was used extensively for querying large datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and aggregating data efficiently.

Once the data was structured, I moved on to exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations between variables such as borrower characteristics, loan amounts, interest rates, and default status. Power BI and Tableau played a significant role in visualizing the findings through interactive dashboards that made complex financial data easy to understand.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Developed
To provide actionable insights, I designed multiple KPIs and dashboards, each focusing on critical aspects of loan performance:

✅ Year wise loan amount stats : Analyzed loan distribution over the years to identify trends in borrowing behavior and lending patterns.

✅ Grade and Subgrade-wise Revolving Balance (revol_bal): Examined the relationship between credit grades and the borrower’s outstanding revolving balance to assess risk levels.

✅ Total Payment for Verified vs. Non-Verified Borrowers: Compared repayment trends based on borrower verification status to determine if verification impacts loan repayment behavior.

✅ State-wise and Last Credit Pull Date-wise Loan Status: Mapped loan default rates across different states and analyzed recent credit pull data to track borrower activity and financial health.

✅ Homeownership vs. Last Payment Date stats: Investigated how homeownership status influenced loan repayments, identifying potential risks associated with different borrower profiles.



**Project Outcomes & Presentation**
After building the dashboards, I focused on making the insights actionable and visually impactful. Using Power BI and Tableau, I created interactive dashboards that allowed stakeholders to filter and drill down into specific data points. The goal was to support data-driven decision-making in financial risk assessment.

To showcase the findings, I prepared a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that included key observations, trends, and recommendations based on data analysis. On the final day of the project, I presented the dashboards and MySQL scripts, demonstrating how these insights could be leveraged to improve loan approval strategies and minimize financial risk.
